# AI Disclaimer

Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools were used extensively throughout the development of this project. 

Specifically, the following AI technologies were utilized:

OpenAI GPT-4o & Anthropic Claude 3.7 – for generating and refining content, code, debugging and documentation.
GitHub Copilot – for real-time coding suggestions and automated code completion within the development environment.

These tools were employed to enhance productivity, improve quality, and accelerate development. 
All AI-generated content was reviewed and validated by the project team to ensure accuracy and appropriateness.

## Database Setup

### Setting Up Authentication Database

1. Create a database named `AUTH` in your SQL Server instance
2. Run the following SQL script to set up the authentication tables:


```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.HashedCredentials (
    UserID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    Username NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Password NVARCHAR(MAX) NOT NULL
);

-- Run the code above and then create the login stored procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_Lab3Login
    @Username NVARCHAR(50)
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;

    SELECT Password 
    FROM HashedCredentials 
    WHERE Username = @Username;
END;

```

3. Initialize with default user accounts (default password is "password" for all accounts):


```sql
INSERT INTO HashedCredentials (Username, Password)
VALUES ('admin', '1000:fF2zbk9sOvF/RDj8S2hVZlgNmNYUMUsz:jJv9Og+6vJq2E+vZ91av8XQil4I=');
INSERT INTO HashedCredentials (Username, Password) 
VALUES ('user1', '1000:fF2zbk9sOvF/RDj8S2hVZlgNmNYUMUsz:jJv9Og+6vJq2E+vZ91av8XQil4I=');
INSERT INTO HashedCredentials (Username, Password) 
VALUES ('user2', '1000:fF2zbk9sOvF/RDj8S2hVZlgNmNYUMUsz:jJv9Og+6vJq2E+vZ91av8XQil4I=');
INSERT INTO HashedCredentials (Username, Password) 
VALUES ('user3', '1000:fF2zbk9sOvF/RDj8S2hVZlgNmNYUMUsz:jJv9Og+6vJq2E+vZ91av8XQil4I=');

```

### Setting Up Main Application Database

1. Create a database named `JMU_CARE` in your SQL Server instance
2. Run the `JMUcare_SQL.txt` script to create all required tables and initial data
3. Update the connection strings in `DBclass.cs` to match your SQL Server instance:


```csharp
public static readonly string JMUcareDBConnString =
    "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=JMU_CARE;Trusted_Connection=True";

private static readonly string? AuthConnString =
    "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=AUTH;Trusted_Connection=True";

```

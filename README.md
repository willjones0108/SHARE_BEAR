### AI Disclaimer

Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools were used extensively throughout the development of this project. 

Specifically, the following AI technologies were utilized:

OpenAI GPT-4o & Anthropic Claude 3.7 – for generating and refining content, code, debugging and documentation.

GitHub Copilot – for real-time coding suggestions and automated code completion within the development environment.

These tools were employed to enhance productivity, improve quality, and accelerate development. 
All AI-generated content was reviewed and validated by the project team to ensure accuracy and appropriateness.

## Database Connection

Please note we migrated OFF of azure back to local host. 
Some functionality may have been impacted, however no bugs were found in our testing in regards to the database.

1.	Create the Databases
•	Set up two databases:
•	AUTH
•	JMU_CARE
2.	Run the Stored Procedure
•	Locate the file sp_Lab3Login.txt in the project directory.
•	Execute the SQL script in sp_Lab3Login.txt on the AUTH database to create the required stored procedure.
3.	Verify the Connection String
•	Open the DBClass file in the project.
•	Ensure the connection strings for both AUTH and JMU_CARE databases are accurate and match your local or server database configuration.

* if you have any errors regarding the database please reach out to jonesww@dukes.jmu.edu
